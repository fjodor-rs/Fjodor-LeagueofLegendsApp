Fjodor-LeagueofLegendsApp is a app that lets you search for your own or others last played games in the game of League of Legends.
It ask you to sign in and then ask for your in-game name and adds it to a database.
It then shows you your match history in a recycleview and lets you click on a match to view extra statistics.
The application also allows you to search for other players, and view their match history.

The original plan was to the player names in the database to compare the stats of the user with other players.
Unfortunately this took to much time to complete within the two week time frame.

The structure and framework of this application was made using the amazing guide by 'tuto::code' on youtube:
